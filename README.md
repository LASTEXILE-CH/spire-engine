- Set GameEngine as start-up project.
- Right click GameEngine project and set the following start-up command:

`
-enginedir "$(SolutionDir)EngineContent" -dir "$(SolutionDir)ExampleGame" -gl
`

To run the engine in editor mode, add `-editor` argument when launching GameEngine.exe:
```
GameEngine.exe -editor -enginedir "$(SolutionDir)EngineContent" -dir "$(SolutionDir)ExampleGame"
```
